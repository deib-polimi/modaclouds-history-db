# Delete Model

When deleting a model from the system (using the REST API [DELETE-model](../rest/model/DELETE-model.md)), a number of triples are inserted in the datastore.

Let's assume that:

* the sub-component that has to save the model in the datastore received it in a certain time (e.g. with a timestamp `1425399022110`, corresponding to the date *Tue, 03 Mar 2015 17:10:22 GMT+1:00*),
* the `:id` parameter in the API had value `id1425399019932`.

The assumption that no other model is considered at the exact same time is done. Then, a graph with the name containing the timestamp above is created (e.g. `http://www.modaclouds.eu/historydb/model/cancellations/1425400773874`).

The graph will contain two triples, both with the value of the `:id` parameter as the subject. Both the predicates will have the base prefix `http://www.modaclouds.eu/rdfs/1.0/deletedmodel#`, and there are:

* `id`, the id of the model that we want to delete,
* `timestamp`, the timestamp in which the message was received.

Another graph with the name associated to the day in which the timestamp is contained (e.g. `http://www.modaclouds.eu/historydb/meta/model/cancellations/1425340800000` for the example above, where `1425340800000` corresponds to the date *Tue, 03 Mar 2015 00:00:00 GMT+1:00*) is created or used if it already exists.
Only one triple is added, and this has as the subject the name of the graph considered before (e.g. `http://www.modaclouds.eu/historydb/model/cancellations/1425400773874`), the predicate `<mo:timestamp>` and the actual timestamp as the object of the triple (e.g. `1425400773874`).

Lastly, in the `default` graph, one tuple is added, with:

* the subject that is the URI of the graph (e.g. `http://www.modaclouds.eu/historydb/model/cancellations/1425400773874`),
* the predicate is the constant `mo:timestamp`, and
* the object is the hour in which the timestamp is contained (e.g. `1425398400000` for the example above, where `1425398400000` corresponds to the date *Tue, 03 Mar 2015 17:00:00 GMT+1:00*).

##Â Examples of Query

Here are some examples of SPARQL query:

* find all the cancellations of model inserted:

```sparql
SELECT * {
    ?s <mo:timestamp> ?o
    FILTER (regex(str(?s), "model/cancellations"))
}
```

* find all the cancellations of model inserted in a specific hourly timestamp:

```sparql
SELECT * {
    ?s <mo:timestamp> ?o 
    FILTER (?o = 1425574800000 && regex(str(?s), "model/cancellations"))
}
```

* find all the cancellations of model inserted in a range of hourly timestamps:

```sparql
SELECT * {
    ?s <mo:timestamp> ?o
    FILTER (?o >= 1425574600000 && ?o <= 1425574900000 && regex(str(?s), "model/cancellations"))
}
```
